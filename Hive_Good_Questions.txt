Pls share your thoughts on below secnarios in hive.

1. Initially Table is empty. Suppose if we are loading 4 GB file to hive table, while the loading process is ongoing - can we access the table ? And will it reflect the data whatever loaded till that time? Pls justify your answer.

2. what is your approach if any of the query/join  is long running. Need answer interms of optimisation. Provided that you are not allowed  to partition/bucket on the table.

3. Hive scripts are automated and running as per the schedule. But some times you observe that queries are failing due to memory issues. How do you tackle this/workaround  in prod environment without impacting the SLA or timelines.

Hi, when we load data to hive table whether it is empty or not there will be exclusive lock will apply to the table in a non partioned table. If it is a partioned table the lock will be apply to the partioned level.when there is a exclusive or write lock you can't access hive table for read...... comming to 2nd question if a query is taking more time you can use vectorization or you can rewrite the query or you can use map side join or cost base optimization. Regarding 3rd I don't have idea.

Thanks

Hi Dayanidhi/Narasimha,

    For the third question also , we can set the mapper , reducer & partition level memory before we are trigger the Hive Queries in a script level
